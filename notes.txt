## Why plain text files is nice
Script was being invoked twice
Did a search in all the files for the script name
I could see it was being autoloaded in the project

## Weird bugs with using an external editor (VS Code)
- Sometimes a script won't update, it's cached in an object itself
- Have to restart to fix that
- Everytime I save in the external editor I get the error:
```txt
 Another resource is loaded from path 'res://dialogue/dialogue.gd' (possible cyclic resource inclusion).
```

## Debugging
- Make a way to show debug text quickly and easily, above object
- Show debug vectors easily
