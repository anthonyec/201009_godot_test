## Why plain text files is nice
Script was being invoked twice
Did a search in all the files for the script name
I could see it was being autoloaded in the project

## Weird bugs with using an external editor (VS Code)
- Sometimes a script won't update, it's cached in an object itself
- Have to restart to fix that
- Everytime I save in the external editor I get the error:
```txt
 Another resource is loaded from path 'res://dialogue/dialogue.gd' (possible cyclic resource inclusion).
```

## Debugging
- Make a way to show debug text quickly and easily, above object
- Show debug vectors easily

## Searchigng for help
- Search for your problem in unity then translate to godot!
- For example, rotating camera around a point only returned results about parenting the camera to a Spatial node with an offset
- Searching for unity gave the example of looking at a target and translating
```unity
    transform.LookAt(target);
    transform.Translate(Vector3.right * Time.deltaTime)
```
```gdscript
	self.look_at(targetObject.global_transform.origin, Vector3.UP)
	self.translate(Vector3.RIGHT * delta)
```
